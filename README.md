**From AI Tools Desktop to Business Solution Operating System.**

AgentCore OS is a Next.js + Tailwind **business solution operating system** that runs in the browser.

It combines a desktop shell, industry workspaces, role-based desks, scenario packages, local-first state,
and AI-powered workflow apps into a single operational entry point.

The project is no longer just a UI shell or an AI tools desktop. It is now aimed at giving teams and
non-technical users a faster way to enter real-world business workflows through packaged solutions,
workspaces, and workflow-driven apps.

## Project status

**Status:** `main` is ahead of `v0.2.0-alpha.1` and currently represents a release candidate state.

Current repository state:
- the desktop shell is usable
- industry workspace selection is available
- multiple packaged scenario apps are included
- one cross-app hero workflow is now runnable for `Sales Desk`
- language-first onboarding is included
- production hardening is **not** complete yet

## What’s new in current `main`

- Industry App Center: switch by industry and scenario instead of browsing isolated tools
- Solutions Hub: packaged mature workflows mapped from real-world use cases
- Multi-language entry: top-level language switcher + first-launch language onboarding
- Packaged business apps: research, content, CRM, meeting, operations, SEO, finance, learning
- Desktop UX: resizable windows + keyboard tiling/restore shortcuts
- Playbooks: local-first SOP install/save/export/import
- Publisher: dry-run and queued dispatch with connector-based publishing
- Publisher config/jobs: file-backed server storage for queue state and connector credentials
- Publisher queue runner: server-side execution path via `/api/publish/queue/run`
- Sales Hero Workflow: `Deal Desk -> Email Assistant -> Personal CRM` now shares runtime state, trigger metadata, and local asset write-back
- Structured inquiry intake: Sales Desk now captures inquiry channel, language preference, product line, and includes a sample inbound lead for first-run demo
- Multi-industry starters: Industry Hub now includes one-click solution starters for sales, creator, support, research, recruiting, and delivery workflows

## Current product positioning

AgentCore OS is now positioned as a **business solution operating system**, not just a browser desktop full of AI apps.

Current product spine:

- `industry` decides which business context the user belongs to
- `role` decides which desk and default working surface should open first
- `workflow` decides the standard sequence, trigger, human review boundary, and result asset path
- `apps` are execution components inside that workflow, not the primary product story

Current flagship example:

- `Sales Desk`
  `客户询盘 / 手动录入 -> Deal Desk -> Email Assistant -> Personal CRM -> 本地销售资产沉淀`

## What it includes

- Window manager: z-order, focus, minimize/restore, drag, snap, position persistence
- Spotlight launcher: app search + command execution
- Local-first storage: settings, drafts, tasks, publish history, app records
- Industry App Center: industry bundles and custom workspace builder
- Solutions Hub: curated real-world workflows you can install as Playbooks
- Playbooks: local-first SOP library (export/import as JSON)
- Multi-language shell: Chinese, English, Japanese, custom language label
- Publishing hub: safe-by-default dispatch with bring-your-own connectors
- Example local webhook connector with receipts UI (`npm run webhook:dev`)
- API routes for LLM / OpenClaw / publish dispatch workflows

## What it does **not** do

- No scraping-based social automation
- No unofficial posting flows against platforms
- No built-in auth / multi-tenant security model
- No production-grade secret storage or auth model by default

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Optional env template:
- [`.env.example`](/Users/aidi/agent桌面/agentcore-os/.env.example)

Open:
- App UI: `http://localhost:3000/`
- Optional local connector UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8787/`

## Optional webhook connector

Run the local connector example:

```bash
npm run webhook:dev
```

Optional: run the publish queue worker without relying on an open browser tab:

```bash
npm run publish-queue:worker
```

Production examples for PM2, `systemd`, and `launchd` live under [`deploy/`](/Users/aidi/agent桌面/agentcore-os/deploy).
Template placeholders and replacement instructions are in [`deploy/README.md`](/Users/aidi/agent桌面/agentcore-os/deploy/README.md).

Then in **Settings → Accounts/Publishing**, set a platform's `Publish Webhook URL` to:

`http://127.0.0.1:8787/webhook/publish`

This example connector only records receipts locally. It does **not** publish to any external platform.

## Safety & compliance

If you build “auto publish” features, do it via:
- official platform APIs, or
- approved third-party services (Buffer / Metricool / Make / Zapier), or
- your own internal tooling with explicit user consent and ToS compliance

This repository is meant to be a practical AI workspace foundation, not a loophole for bypassing platform rules.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — run the app in development mode
- `npm run dev:clean` — clear `.next-dev` and start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run start` — run production server
- `npm run stable` — rebuild cleanly and run production server on port 3000
- `npm run lint` — lint
- `npm run webhook:dev` — run local webhook connector example
- `npm run publish-queue:worker` — poll `/api/publish/queue/run` as a background worker

## Open-source hygiene

Before publishing changes:
- review [docs/OPEN_SOURCE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/OPEN_SOURCE_CHECKLIST.md)
- make sure no secrets, private identifiers, or build artifacts are committed
- run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`
